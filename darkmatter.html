			Dark Matter? What is that?
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Dark matter is an unidentified type of matter comprising approximately 27% of the mass and energy in the observable universe that is not accounted for by dark energy, baryonic matter (ordinary matter), and neutrinos.</p>

			<p> No, not that “Dark Matter”
			I’m talking about Dark Matter TV Series. For those who don’t know what the show is all about, I will explain briefly below. </p>

			<img src="images/darkmatter.png">

			<p> Dark Matter is a Canadian science fiction series created by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie, based on their comic book of the same name. The first season was premiered on June 12, 2015 and the second season is airing now on Syfy and Space Channel. </p>

			<p> The genre of this show is Space Opera, which emphasizes space warfare, dramatic adventure, and risk-taking interplanetary battles, and romance as well. Interesting right? From a big futuristic energy weapon, sophisticated tech like cloning and teleportation to something like inter-dimensional space time travel things? Huh, what are those? Confusing and questioning, on the other hand, makes me want to see more of it everytime the new episode comes out.</p>

			<p> Okay, now back to the title. Why Dark Matter? </br>

			This is the story… </br>

			I was lying in my bed, trying to find something to watch on my TV, pressing “Channel up” multiple times and “Channel down” multiple times and I couldn’t find anything worth watching. Then, it was Syfy’s turn to appear on the TV when something caught my attention. A beautiful young girl with a weird and funny short green hair. (It’s Jodelle Ferland everybody!) </p>

			<img src="images/jodelle.jpg">

			<p> Her hair and the “Dark Matter” title itself were so catchy that I stopped and decided to watch the whole episode. That was when Syfy was airing the first season again somewhere between March and April this year. That day I was watching episode 11, and I managed to see Two got spaced away from the airlock (spoiler for those who haven’t watched), and I was just like “What the?”. So I started my Dark Matter journey by witnessing someone got killed? Although later on that episode she turned out to be healthy and alive (another spoiler). </p>

			<p> After watching that episode, my impression was, “wow that is one of the best show I’ve ever seen. The best maybe.” I realized that the show was different. Different from any other shows I’ve ever watched. I don’t know why, but just different. The story plots, how the actors and the actresses play their roles, the effects, mysteries, are different from the other (maybe because I love space, planets, stars and something like that) . Yes, I was still young and I am still now. I haven’t got that much experience on watching TV shows, but that doesn’t mean that I can’t point out my opinions. I just love the show more than any other show. I spent 5 days to complete the first season streaming.</p>

			<p> It has been 2 years since I started watching TV series. The Walking Dead was my favorite back then. I’ve also watched Haven, Continuum, Wayward Pines, and some other horror, drama, sci-fi shows and I’ve never, never find anything like Dark Matter. Too bad I didn’t catch up with Star Wars and Star Trek, they can complete my life too and too bad I haven’t got a chance to see other Joe Mallozzi’s creations, such as Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. Just like Dark Matter, they must be amazing and outstanding.</p>

			<p> Check out the show now!
			When and where to watch Dark Matter:</p>

			<p> In conclusion, I can say that teaching, learning, and researching is the three most important thing in education for all. Applying “7 Habits” and these methods in Indonesian education system, will make positive impact in national field as well as in international field of Indonesian Education. </p>
