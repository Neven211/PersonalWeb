			<p"> EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT! </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em"> The following text is my writing about Indonesian education for my English Essay Competition in 2014.</p>

			<p> First of all, let us start with what is EDUCATION? Education in general is a form of learning in which the knowledge, skills, and habits of a group of people are transferred from one person to other person through teaching and training. Just like teachers and our parents teaching us about everything we need to know in academic fields as well as in social life and life skills. </p>

			<p> To improve Indonesian education system, first I want to increase the people awareness of how important the library is. How library is connected to education? Library comes from Latin, “liber” or “libri”, and it mean book. Book is the most valuable thing in education, because book is the perfect agent or medium where the knowledge is transferred from one to other person through a long period of time. This is why, we can gain more knowledge by reading books and we can explore and investigate everything from the past. </p>

			<p> Second, I want to make all schools as a facility to educate, not as a business land for single person or a group. As we see in Indonesia, there are many schools that only consider schools are only for making money, so that people tend to search for shortcuts such as corruption. To end this problem, government has to involve, by giving subsidy to all schools and even build free school for all people especially for the one who in need. </p>

			<p> For the third one, this is the most suitable method for Indonesian new curriculum or what we say, “K13”. K13 teach us that the most important thing in every site is behavior. If we behave well, people will see us as a good person, especially when we have to work and make money ourselves, therefore “7 Habits” are very useful techniques. “7 Habits” are based on Stephen Covey’s book titled “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People”. First habit, “Be Proactive” means we  have to take  initiative on doing every activities. Second, “Begin With The End In Mind” means first we have to think what will happen in the end when we are about take a certain decision that affecting our future life before taking the decision. Third, “Put First Thing First” means we have to do what the most important thing in our life first. Fourth, “Think Win-Win” means think the best mutually beneficial solutions or agreements that make we and other people are in win-win situation. </p>

			<p> Fifth, “Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood”, means we have to listen and understand other’s sayings first to be understood by other. This creates an atmosphere of caring and positive problem solving. Sixth, “Synergize” means we have to Combine the strengths of people through teamwork, so that we can achieve goals no one person could have done alone. The last but not the least is “Sharpen The Saw” and it means renew and develop our skill and knowledge so that we can gain more knowledge. These habits have to be applied to every school in Indonesia. </p>

			<p> The fourth way is to make all schools to emphasize on foreign language such as English so that people in Indonesia,  especially the children that will be Indonesia’s next generation could learn and use this language as the second language to ease communication to other people from other nations and make our relation with other nations better. People who can speak English or other language such as Spanish, Mandarin, French, German, and Russian as the most important language to learn in the world will have “more value” and this makes we easy to find jobs or business partners later. </p>

			<p> The fifth way is by increasing the effectivity of the Government’s Final Examinations. Increasing the final examination’s standard will be the best way, because this will “force” or “push” student’s learning spirit and the use of . All the students in Indonesia have to pass the higher standard. This new policy will surely make huge impact to the students in remote places in Indonesia that can not get the same education as in the urban cities. To get over this problem, sending teachers and books to that places will work, also by giving free school and building a good place to study will end this thing. </p>

			<p> The last way to increase the quality of “Education For All” is by making practical work assignments in learning more often, thus students will be more active during studying and make the students make their own research. This method will increase students’ learning skills, and researching or experiment assignments will be the students’ learning experience and as Julius Caesar said, “Experience is the teacher of all things”.</p>

			<p> In conclusion, I can say that teaching, learning, and researching is the three most important thing in education for all. Applying “7 Habits” and these methods in Indonesian education system, will make positive impact in national field as well as in international field of Indonesian Education. </p>
